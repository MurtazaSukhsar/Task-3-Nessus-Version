- **High:** 1
- **Medium:** 2
- **Low:** 1
- **Informational:** 34

## Critical Vulnerability
### 1. SMB Signing Disabled
- **Description:** SMB signing is not required on the remote Windows system, allowing an attacker to carry out man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.
- **Risk:** Could allow interception or modification of SMB traffic.
- **Remediation:** Enable SMB signing on all SMB servers and clients. Apply the latest Windows updates.

---

## High Vulnerability
### 2. Outdated Windows 7 Operating System
- **Description:** Windows 7 has reached end of life and no longer receives security updates from Microsoft.
- **Risk:** Highly exploitable due to unpatched vulnerabilities.
- **Remediation:** Upgrade to a supported Windows version (Windows 10/11) or apply available extended security updates.

---

## Medium Vulnerabilities
### 3. SSL/TLS Version 1.0 Protocol Detection
- **Description:** The remote service supports TLS 1.0, which has known cryptographic weaknesses.
- **Risk:** Allows downgrade and interception attacks.
- **Remediation:** Disable TLS 1.0 and enable only TLS 1.2 or later.

### 4. SMBv1 Enabled
- **Description:** SMBv1 is enabled, which is vulnerable to attacks like EternalBlue.
- **Risk:** Remote code execution possible.
- **Remediation:** Disable SMBv1 protocol.

---

## Low Vulnerability
### 5. ICMP Timestamp Response
- **Description:** The host responds to ICMP timestamp requests, revealing system time.
- **Risk:** Low â€” can assist in reconnaissance.
- **Remediation:** Disable ICMP timestamp responses if not required.

---

## Informational Findings
- Open ports detected: 135/tcp, 139/tcp, 445/tcp, 3389/tcp
- Host OS fingerprint: Microsoft Windows 7 Professional
- Services allow for further investigation if authenticated scanning is enabled.

## Recommendations
1. Apply all security patches available for Windows 7.
2. Disable outdated and insecure protocols (SMBv1, TLS 1.0).
3. Enable firewall rules to limit access to administrative ports.
4. Consider migrating to a supported operating system for ongoing security updates.
